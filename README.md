# An Introduction to Programming with Python

##A tutorial for EuroScipy 2016 Erlangen

## Getting started
Welcome to this python tutorial. This is a pretty hands-on tutorial, with lots of small coding exercises for you to do. You're going to need a laptop with python 3 installed. If you don't have a laptop, find someone to share with! If you don't have python, the [Anaconda distribution](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install) is great! Follow the installation instructions and it should **just work**.

You will also need [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) to view and edit the tutorial scripts. Jupyter should come packaged with the Anaconda python distribution.

To get started, clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/rebeccaroisin/python_tutorial.git`) or download the zip file and unpack it.

Open a terminal window and `cd` to the folder containing the tutorial scripts. Launch a Jupyter notebook from this directory:

```
jupyter notebook
```

## The Tutorial

You can view the slides for this tutorial [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1outlgmxhjH3FczzbTKXS7NuzA1_LZxF3dzrjB5Zf7hQ/edit?usp=sharing).

The first part of the tutorial is in *python_tutorial.ipynb*. 

Then there are two more extended programming tasks:
* *solitaire.ipynb* will walk you through implementing a simulation of a game of Solitaire.
* *Data Analysis.ipynb* makes a simple visualisation of a two-dimensional dataset.

Finally, there is an extension task in *ClassySolitaire.ipynb* if you have time.

Have fun!
